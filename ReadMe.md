#Simple MVVM exapmle

This is My Second studiing project for learning swift language. This time it was MVVM pattern.
I create it after whatching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yMtKZb-BO0 and this is a first step before next part of understanding Coordinator pattern with MVVM.


What was new for me:
1. typealias. Never seen this key word at videos.
2. how works binding.
